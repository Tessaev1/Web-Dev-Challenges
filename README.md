This repository contains the various projects I completed during my Web Development course, Info 343, at the University of Washington. All the starter code was provided by our professor, Dr. David Stearns.

This course introduced me to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, various CSS frameworks, AJAX, React, Webpack / npm, Redux, and various other tools, frameworks, libraries, and concepts related to the world of web development.
